i have no way to verify anything here. i don't know the source myself so i don't know if they are reliable but take from this what you will

I have some information and screenshots from the next five nights at freddys security breach reveal

the reveal is in set to the middle of October

it will show the first level of the game and a new trailer

it will show a mode called cinematic with ray tracing set to the max and fps is 30(this is for ps5) and it has some visual artifacts because its not polished yet but it looks really realistic. artifacts should be fixed by the time the game comes out

here are the screenshots(they were resized before posting so they are not had):

take this with a grain of salt. i don't trust this leak and you shouldn't trust a 4chan leak lol but speculation is cool and who knows it might be real. just be careful because this game has too many hoaxes.also i heard there is gameplay videos leaked on twitter but i couldn't find anything so probably not real
