277) Вы сказали, что Breaking + Entering служит важным прологом к игре, что вы хотели этим сказать, и как это вписывается в игру?
--------------------------------------------------------
Это вам предстоит выяснить.
--------------------------------------------------------
276) На "Фнаф Плюс" будут испанские субтитры???
--------------------------------------------------------
может быть???
--------------------------------------------------------
275) Будет ли Фокси бегать по коридору, как в оригинальной игре?
--------------------------------------------------------
да.
--------------------------------------------------------
272) будет ли еще какая-нибудь игра, связанная с FNAF+?
--------------------------------------------------------
не мне решать.
--------------------------------------------------------
271) Есть ли какие-то крупные достижения в процессе разработки игры, которые вы приобрели во время создания FNaF+?
Кроме того, будет ли FNaF+ каким-либо образом использовать возможности "галлюцинаций", которые мы имели в FNaF до сиквелов? Такие вещи, как редкие экраны, "IT'S ME" и т.д.
--------------------------------------------------------
я узнал много нового о GMS2 и анимации в целом.
У меня есть план по созданию крутых жутких вещей.
--------------------------------------------------------
270) Будет ли "детектор призраков" играть важную роль в игре?
--------------------------------------------------------
не очень важную роль, но он вернется в той или иной форме.
--------------------------------------------------------
269) Было ли/есть ли стресс от наличия фанатов, которые очень строги к играм? Это большое давление с их стороны?
--------------------------------------------------------
Это было довольно ошеломляюще, но ничего, я справлюсь!
в конце концов, я делаю игры для себя, поэтому публичное восприятие моих проектов - это просто бонус, которым можно наслаждаться.
--------------------------------------------------------
267) как долго вы работаете над фнафплюс
--------------------------------------------------------
около года.
--------------------------------------------------------
266) если бы вас попросили, вы бы сделали "фнаф 2 плюс"?
--------------------------------------------------------
по инициативе Скотта? Возможно.
--------------------------------------------------------
265) Если Скотт когда-нибудь попросит вас вернуться и сделать продолжение или приквел к FNAF+, вы бы взяли за основу одну из существующих игр FNAF и привнесли в нее свою собственную изюминку? (как вы это сделали с Plus) или вы бы создали совершенно новый проект, не основанный ни на одной из игр?
--------------------------------------------------------
Это сложный вопрос.
лично мне хотелось бы сделать официальную часть серии ФНАФ, не основанной ни на одной из предыдущих игр.
но я также не против высказать свое мнение о некоторых классических играх.
не уверен, надо подумать.
--------------------------------------------------------

I was wondering, what was the process of coming up with the new designs like? I love them.
--------------------------------------------------------
thank you!

wanted to take each character and give them some kind of unique "deal".

-Freddy should be mostly the same, just with added detail.

-Bonnie needed some kind of uncanny creepy characteristic.

-Foxy should be threatening.
--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
100 chicken-sized kangaroos, i could kick the shit out of them.
--------------------------------------------------------
228) Does Foxy still sing, Phil
--------------------------------------------------------
id love to keep the original sounds for a possible "Classic Mode" option.

--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
222) Why

why not?
--------------------------------------------------------
221) Have you heard of  #fnafpluspack?
by the way, congratulations on the 20k followers ; )
--------------------------------------------------------
no, looks cool though.

thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------
220) idk if you respond this but,Will the game have an anti-piracy system or something like that? or how will it be?
--------------------------------------------------------
i dont like drm so i won't go out of my way to screw over pirates, i'd like to focus on bringing value to the people that *would* actually purchase the game and support it properly.

maybe through achievements or trading cards cloud saves, stuff like that.
--------------------------------------------------------
219) hey phisnom! so whenever the full games comes to a release, what platforms are you thinking on releasing the game on? i see how much work u have put onto FNaF+ and it is amazing so far :)
--------------------------------------------------------
i dont have much say on the porting side of the project, that would depend on whoever ports it. im just focusing on PC right now.

also thank you!
--------------------------------------------------------
218) The sound of Freddy's nose will be the same of the original or it will be changed?
--------------------------------------------------------
the original sound will probably be there as an option for hardcore fans.
--------------------------------------------------------
217) Will the FNAF + story close at the end of the game or will it leave the door open for possible later games? (PD: You really keep me excited about this project :) )
--------------------------------------------------------
i'd like the story of the game to be somewhat self-contained. i don't like big cliffhanger endings.
--------------------------------------------------------
216) Hey Phil! Two questions:

Are animatronics going to have voices?

And are there going to be more animatronics besides Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and Puppet?
--------------------------------------------------------
no.

too many animatronics would crowd the gameplay of FNAF1.
--------------------------------------------------------
215) what do you think of the walten files?
--------------------------------------------------------
i love the crappy children's book aesthetic of the characters and environment.

story seems more competent than what's currently going on in fnaf.

i find the attempts at scary spooky distorted faces silly.

bunnyfarm was cool.
--------------------------------------------------------
214) Coffee or tea?
--------------------------------------------------------
coffee.
--------------------------------------------------------
213) Do you plan to make more fnaf plus shorts in the future to further hype up the games release or just make a gameplay reveal trailer?
--------------------------------------------------------
B+E is the last video teaser for FNAF Plus.
--------------------------------------------------------
212) Is freddy fazbear in fnaf plus
--------------------------------------------------------
maybe.
--------------------------------------------------------
211) Is FNaF Plus a PC exclusive?
--------------------------------------------------------
i am focusing on PC, but there are plans to port the game onto other platforms after its release.
--------------------------------------------------------
210) Not sure if you can answer this but:

What will the general feel of the story be like?

Will it be a sad one or pure horror?
--------------------------------------------------------
it's darker and more horror-focused than what FNAF usually is.
--------------------------------------------------------
209) First of all, congrats on your 20k followers! For sure you deserve more! If you allow me to say, i loved the teasers of Fnaf plus! I'm very hyped for it!

Well, my question is:

Do you have plans to continue the history of Fnaf+? (Example: making a Fnaf+2 or Fnaf+3 etc)
--------------------------------------------------------
thank you lots!

not my choice to make.
--------------------------------------------------------
208) Will the animatronics have animation when they are on camera?
--------------------------------------------------------
https://twitter.com/FNAFPLUS/status/1399508271094976516
--------------------------------------------------------
207) tem alguma data de lançamento estimada para o jogo?
--------------------------------------------------------
i dont.
--------------------------------------------------------
206) Is pork chops horror show still in development?
--------------------------------------------------------
on hold at the moment.
--------------------------------------------------------
205) Why did Scott choose you for FNAF+ in comparison to other fabganr devs that have been making some revamped versions of the games?
--------------------------------------------------------
i talked to him about what i'd do to improve each of the games and he liked my ideas.
--------------------------------------------------------
204) Aside from Goodbye to Spring and Follow Me, were there other songs you were considering for the trailers?
--------------------------------------------------------
yes.
--------------------------------------------------------
203) Is this game gonna be harder than the original FNaF 1?
--------------------------------------------------------
definitely.
--------------------------------------------------------
202) Will balloon boy be in this game?
--------------------------------------------------------
no.
--------------------------------------------------------
201) What kind of fnaf plus merch would YOU like to see? ( like plushies, action figures, Statues, etc.)
--------------------------------------------------------
Plushies, figurines and recreations of in-game props would be nice.
--------------------------------------------------------
200) What are apples?
--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
199) will the toreador march part be keepen? thats my favorite part.
--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
198) will there ever be a FNAF Plus 2?
--------------------------------------------------------
not my choice to make.
--------------------------------------------------------
197) Will there be intersections after night?
and you plan a
FNAF PLUS 2?
--------------------------------------------------------
intersections?
not my choice.
--------------------------------------------------------
196) Small question how much influence did Scott have on the design of the fnaf plus was he involved alot or not at all. even smaller question, when is fnaf divide coming out?
--------------------------------------------------------
he had to approve a huge 20-page design document, commented on the character designs, and we talked about the general improvements/changes i'd make to the game for a while.

who knows.
--------------------------------------------------------
195) Congratulations on the 20k

Will there be cinematics?
--------------------------------------------------------
thanks!

not really.
--------------------------------------------------------
194) Will Chica have more songs, like the ones from B+E and Stage Performance? And are there any plans for a Custom Night mode?
--------------------------------------------------------
B+E was the last planned teaser for the game.
yes.
--------------------------------------------------------
193) One question, first of all congratulations on your 20k followers and the B + E teaser, that was amazing.

Are you going to continue making games from the entire series? I mean if you will do a FNaF 2+, FNaF 3 or will there only be FNaF +? and good afternoon jjj
--------------------------------------------------------
thank you!

not my choice to make.
--------------------------------------------------------
192) will the office have halloween decorations when playing during october 31st? like the original game?
--------------------------------------------------------
no.
--------------------------------------------------------
191) this might be a spoiler but thought id ask

will there be a night 6 and/or custom night?

also congrats on 20k!
--------------------------------------------------------
there are three bonus modes currently planned for the game.
--------------------------------------------------------
190) the Multiverse is gonna get open?
--------------------------------------------------------
what.
--------------------------------------------------------
189) Are there going to be cutscenes in the game?
--------------------------------------------------------
what do you mean by "cutscenes"?
--------------------------------------------------------
188) If you had the ability to pick any company to handle merch for the game, what company would it be?
--------------------------------------------------------
Good Smile Company.
--------------------------------------------------------
187) It's One nights at flumpty's 3 a good game?
--------------------------------------------------------
yup.
--------------------------------------------------------
186) Do you have any kind of last minute changes while in development? If so, can you describe, even if it's vague
--------------------------------------------------------
some things were shuffled around since the original plans back when i made the game's design document.

biggest one had to be the exclusion of Phone Guy, that was kind of a huge disappointment. had to scrap an entire script because of it.
--------------------------------------------------------
185) How big is the puppets role in fnaf+?
--------------------------------------------------------
who?
--------------------------------------------------------
184) I have some questions about Fnaf Plus so if you can answer just one I'm happy 
1. Will Fnaf Plus come to mobile devices and consoles?
 2. Fnaf Plus will have support for other languages 
3. Will Fnaf Plus have products in the future? Funko pop, action figure, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------
1. that's the plan.
2. maybe, im considering the option.
3. not my place to say.
--------------------------------------------------------
183) The story of fnaf plus will be different or not
--------------------------------------------------------
yes
--------------------------------------------------------
182) Apart from Helpy and puppet, there will be references to the other Fnaf Games?
--------------------------------------------------------
yes.
--------------------------------------------------------
181) Will there be door lights or will you use a flashlight
--------------------------------------------------------
cant answer that.
--------------------------------------------------------
180) Not sure if you can answer this, but will the game's core mechanics be identical to the original game or will you do stuff that's not like fixed camera angles and point and click too?
--------------------------------------------------------
the game's core mechanics will change somewhat, in a way that will (hopefully) scare fans of the original while keeping the same classic feel of FNAF 1.
--------------------------------------------------------
179) Will there be any pork chop Easter eggs?
--------------------------------------------------------
no.
--------------------------------------------------------
178) ¿How many endings will there be in FNAF Plus?
--------------------------------------------------------
as many as FNAF 1.
--------------------------------------------------------
177) Will 4/20 mode return? And if so, will you have a contest to who can beat it first?.. And if both of those questions are a no, will FNAF + have that little halloween theme to the office every October 31st?
--------------------------------------------------------
i dont think there would be a way to definitively decide who would "beat" the hardest challenge of FNAF Plus.
--------------------------------------------------------
176) Would it be Amazing to have actual Plushies and Action Figures for FNAF Plus?
--------------------------------------------------------
it would.
--------------------------------------------------------
175) Congrats the 20k!! What is your favourite anime ? UwU
--------------------------------------------------------
thank you!

Azumanga Daioh.
--------------------------------------------------------
174) Of all the animatronics you created
Which one is your favourite?
--------------------------------------------------------
its a toss up between Bonnie, Foxy and a few others.
--------------------------------------------------------
173) Are there gonna be little cutscenes at the end of nights/jumpscares? Like minigames or eyeless animatronics
--------------------------------------------------------
no minigames.
--------------------------------------------------------
172) Is golden freddy going to have a bigger role in fnaf plus then from the og fnaf? Also will golden freddy have a desgin somewhat slightly more then just recolored freddy?
--------------------------------------------------------
what do you think?
--------------------------------------------------------
171) I was wondering how gory the game will be? The original series never really did much more than the game over screen in 1 and springtrap as far as gore goes and I'd love to see a much more graphic interpretation
--------------------------------------------------------
im not really focusing on gore, but the game will certainly be darker than the original.
--------------------------------------------------------
170) I remember you had tweeted out a poll asking what kind of minigames should be in Plus, now you've confirmed there won't be any, did something change during development? Or have you replaced them with something else?
--------------------------------------------------------
i didnt do that?

if anything i wanted to know what kinds of minigames people like. but that doesnt mean id decide on something as important as that based on twitter polls.
--------------------------------------------------------
169) Who was ur favorite to design in #FNAFPLUS
--------------------------------------------------------
between Bonnie and Foxy.
--------------------------------------------------------
168) I dunno what to ask outside of fnaf plus but will we be saying any gameplay footage soon?
--------------------------------------------------------
nop.
--------------------------------------------------------
167) Have you ever thought of doing a fnaf plus 2?
--------------------------------------------------------
not my choice to make.
--------------------------------------------------------
166) This is probably one you get alot but...

Favorite fnaf game and why?
for me it's FNAF 1 because I'm a sucker for nostalgia.
--------------------------------------------------------
FNAF1, best atmosphere and least flawed gameplay, a bit too simple nowadays though, FNAF3 is a close second.
--------------------------------------------------------
165) Okay Whats Your Favorite Shirt.
--------------------------------------------------------
the one im wearing right now.
--------------------------------------------------------
164) Will Fnaf+ have custom night?
--------------------------------------------------------
yes.
--------------------------------------------------------
163) will there be a kitchen camera?
--------------------------------------------------------
yes.
--------------------------------------------------------
162) Forgot to say, congrats on 20k Followers! You deserve them all and even more!

However, I've got another questions

Would it be possible to see book characters in FNaF+? Unless it's something you can't answer

Will animatronics move on cameras? Would be really neat to see
--------------------------------------------------------
thank you!

i haven't read the books.

there's a lot more animations in Plus than FNAF 1 originally had.
--------------------------------------------------------
161) If you were given the opportunity to remake every single mainline game in the series fnaf + style, would you, and what would you change?
--------------------------------------------------------
that is too big of a question.

wouldn't be opposed to remaking 2 or 3 if i were given the chance to though.
--------------------------------------------------------
160) Have you made some of the sounds for FNAF Plus or are most of them bought through asset stores and whatnot? I know you have some limitations with this project and I've been curious about it for a while
--------------------------------------------------------
made some sounds, bought some others, all depends on what fits best for the game.
--------------------------------------------------------
159) If FNAF PLUS is a success, will you release FNAF PLUS 2?
--------------------------------------------------------
not my choice to make.
--------------------------------------------------------
158) will there be extras of some sorts where we could see behind the scenes stuff and some old ideas
--------------------------------------------------------
yes.
--------------------------------------------------------
157) Will the game release on mobile and console?
--------------------------------------------------------
that's Scott's plan.
--------------------------------------------------------
156) Do you have any particular inspiration for the + animatronics designs? :]
--------------------------------------------------------
i like the stories and videos about the characters at Billy Bob's Wonderland.
--------------------------------------------------------
155) How was your day?
--------------------------------------------------------
p good.
--------------------------------------------------------
154) there will be cinematics When we just started the game
--------------------------------------------------------
there will be an intro screen.
--------------------------------------------------------
153) what are your favorite games?
--------------------------------------------------------
Resident Evil 4, RE2 Remake, RE1 Remake, Dead Rising, Devil May Cry 3, Portal 2, GTA San Andreas.
--------------------------------------------------------
152) if fnaf plus is successful will there be any chance of having a fnaf 2 plus?
--------------------------------------------------------
not my choice to make.
--------------------------------------------------------
151) Would you be open to making more + games for like fnaf two and three?
--------------------------------------------------------
wouldn't be opposed to the idea, but it's not my choice to make.
--------------------------------------------------------
150) Which level from Help Wanted is your favourite one?
--------------------------------------------------------
Curse of Dreadbear's "Danger! Keep Out!"
--------------------------------------------------------
149) in BNE, do any of the animatronics (including the puppet) have any malicious intent towards the kid that breaks in?
--------------------------------------------------------
depends on what you mean by "malicious".
--------------------------------------------------------
148) Any elements you wished you could have added to the game that sadly just don’t work?
--------------------------------------------------------
i was debating for a really long time whether or not Balloon Boy could have worked in the game.

he does not. he's too different from the rest of the cast.
--------------------------------------------------------
147) Will the kitchen camera still be audio only?
--------------------------------------------------------
you can hear things in the kitchen.
--------------------------------------------------------
146) How different is the gameplay of FNAF Plus gonna be from regular FNAF?
--------------------------------------------------------
different enough to be scary and new to old players. not different enough to stop feeling like classic FNAF.
--------------------------------------------------------
145) Idk if you can answer those, but whatever:
Discarded ideas for the designs of the animatronics?
How did you get the idea of adding pants to all the animatronics?
There is something you wanted, or still wanting to add, but you, in some way, can't add those ideas into the game?
--------------------------------------------------------
- tried out actual fur particles, didn't look right.
- the originals looked naked.
- Springtrap bursting out of the safe room on Night 7.
--------------------------------------------------------
144) Have you made merch designs ready for if your offered to make merch?
--------------------------------------------------------
nop.
--------------------------------------------------------
143) Are there going to be any major easter eggs hidden in FNAF+ that will hint to the larger universe that it resides in?
--------------------------------------------------------
kind of.
--------------------------------------------------------
142) If FNAFPLUS is successful and you want to and are given a chance to do a +version of any of the other original 6 Five Nights at Freddy's titles which one of them would you like to do the most?
--------------------------------------------------------
FNAF 3.
--------------------------------------------------------
141) what inspired you to incorporate elements from future FNAF games into Plus? was it difficult deciding what aspects to include?
--------------------------------------------------------
i'm a fan of the series in general, it would have been a missed opportunity to be a purist and not include other elements of the franchise into this game.
--------------------------------------------------------
140) was the body in freddy in B&E the night guard? and how long had they been there?
--------------------------------------------------------
he had a bad night.
--------------------------------------------------------
139) favorite fnaf game / fan game :)
--------------------------------------------------------
FNAF1 / TJoC:SM
--------------------------------------------------------
138) Hey Phil, was there any particular inspiration for the animatronic redesigns aside from the original FNAF 1 gang?
--------------------------------------------------------
i really liked the busted up look of the animatronics at Billy Bob's Wonderland.

i also took various design elements from their incarnations throughout the series.
--------------------------------------------------------
137) Is FNAF+ having any kind of minigames?
--------------------------------------------------------
no.
--------------------------------------------------------
136) Do you know a hat in time? Lol
--------------------------------------------------------
yea, played the game, pretty cute.
--------------------------------------------------------
135) Since Scott isn't going to be returning his role as Phone Guy, are you going to be hiring voice actors to fill in the role?

all the nights are pretty barebones and disconnected from eachother, i understood 0% of the plot, and the character designs are so weird and wildly varying.

i was actually debating this. i like when remakes use the original game's iconic sounds, but id also like to try something new.

--------------------------------------------------------
Porkchop's Adventure.
--------------------------------------------------------

If you had to fight a Springtrap twice the size of you or 20 plushtraps half the size of you, who are you taking on? 

Have a good day :)
--------------------------------------------------------
i'd take the 20 plushtraps, they'd be perfect run-over-with-a-truck height.
--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
no.
--------------------------------------------------------
47) Is it Possible for a Future to Make a FNaF plus 2?
 I know it is very hasty and everything, but would you be interested in doing a Plus of the second Game?
--------------------------------------------------------
not my choice to make.
--------------------------------------------------------
46) Will the gameplay be more intense and frightening than the og FNaF?
--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
Kane sucks and owes me money.
--------------------------------------------------------
42) This prooooooobably falls under spoilers but I'm shooting my shot anyway

Will Golden Freddy be present for FNaF+ or is he being removed in favour of other animatronics (eg, Puppet)?
--------------------------------------------------------
you certainly tried to ask that question.
--------------------------------------------------------
41) how different is the gameplay in plus compared to the original game? obviously i mean they're the same premise but are the mechanics greatly varied or relatively similar?
--------------------------------------------------------
the mechanics are different for sure.

--------------------------------------------------------
i dont usually buy figures.
--------------------------------------------------------
39) How much will FNaF Plus be longer than FNaF 1? 
Will Foxy be able to run through both hallways?
Will we finally see something on the Kitchen  Camera?
--------------------------------------------------------
i want FNAF Plus to be as long as the original FNAF 1, but also have some bonus post-game features that fans of the series will enjoy and spend a lot of time on.
--------------------------------------------------------
38) Will any of semi-mysterious elements of the first game play more of a role? Like the kitchen?
--------------------------------------------------------
a lot of the secrets and mysteries of the first game will be expanded on.
--------------------------------------------------------
37) Phisnom I have my doubt The custom night will include challenges to get collectables or just the classic 20/20/20/20?
--------------------------------------------------------
i have something special planned for a Custom Night mode that i think fans will very much enjoy.
--------------------------------------------------------
36) Are we finally going to get the reveal of The bite of 87?!
--------------------------------------------------------
the what?
--------------------------------------------------------
35) My question is how will the controls be handled. Will we be able to switch on the fly from a gamepad to keyboard and mouse and vice-versa? Will there be freedom for button mapping or other customizations? What platforms can or cannot have which input options?
--------------------------------------------------------
planning for the game to have a wide variety of control options, since i like that kind of thing.

mouse only, keyboard only, and gamepad only are my plans atm.

not sure about button mapping, maybe different layouts? but that might be too overcomplicated for me.
--------------------------------------------------------
34) Will FNaF Plus have behind the scenes stuff in it's extras menu (assuming it'll have one)?
I'd love to see things like modelling wips, scrapped content and designs, some technical stuff, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------
yep!
--------------------------------------------------------
33) In the breaking and entering video in the office there was only one lever which I assume it's for the door. Where is the light lever? I might have missed it or something.
--------------------------------------------------------
you think im going to answer that?
--------------------------------------------------------
32) Worst time where you said x thing wouldnt happen and x thing ended up happening?
--------------------------------------------------------
i said that the pandemic wasnt going to be that big of a deal.

jesus fuck was i wrong.
--------------------------------------------------------
31) How are you doing :) especially after the release of B&E.

You talked about how much effort went into B&E and even making it during a busy month. Must have been nice to finally release it, to glowing reviews too!!
--------------------------------------------------------------
pretty well, i love the fanart thats been pouring in.

just taking a break from development for this week and the previous one to regain my energy.

the reception to B+E was absolutely perfect and way bigger than i expected it to be. 15k live viewers on the premiere was insane.
----------------------------------------------------------------
30) Favorite story moment from a FNaF game?
Purple Guy's first death at the end of FNAF3.

29) do you plan on showing any gameplay before release or are you keeping it hidden until its out?
i have a small gameplay showcase planned before the release of the game.

28) Will you ever expand this FNAF PLUS Series to the other FNAFs
not my choice to make.

27) Who Was Your Favorite Character to Redesign?
Bonnie for sure.

26) Do the FNAF PLUS animatronics get some sort of title? Similar to the Toys, Funtimes, Rockstars, etc
nah it's just their names.

if you want to differentiate them from their original counterparts though, i suppose you could put "+" at the  end of their names.

so "Freddy+", "Bonnie+", "Chica+", etc.

25) Who designed these new iterations of the characters? Is there something you would change in their design?
i did, and nope, they came out pretty much exactly how i wanted them to.

24) I got a few questions, have you found a replacement for Phone Guy? Will there be more free roam sections where you explore? Are there more enemies in the game that haven't been revealed yet? That's all, keep up the good work.
Phone Guy will not return in #FNAFPLUS.

it's sad, but I can't really do anything about it, it was not my choice to make it was Scott's.

however, I do have something planned as an alternative that I think fans may enjoy, we'll see.

23) if you were given the opportunity to make any kind of merchandise you want for plus, what would you choose?
a Ghost Detector mp3 player/radio containing songs used throughout the FNAF franchise.

bobbleheads of the main cast.

Cupcake hand puppet.

Azumanga Daioh, Gravity Falls, The Good Place, The Owl House, Konosuba.

my tastes are all over the place.

who knows.

Bonnie was the most straightforward and satisfying model to make for the game.

he is baby.

18) How long does the coding take in FNAF Plus?
you don't code in FNAF Plus.

17) Out of all of your previous projects which are you still proud of / think still holds up today?

yes and then he'll burst out of the safe room on Night 7 and then powerbomb the night guard through a table.

14) How hard was it to design the animatronics? Did you have trouble trying to distinguish them from Scott's models?
Freddy took like 15 versions/revisions to get right.

Bonnie came out perfectly as I wanted him to be out of the oven.

Chica took a bit less time than Freddy.

Foxy had two major revisions, picked the best one.

13) your favorite fan game?
TJoC:SM.

12) why do freddy and bonnie not have real cloth pants
real clothes would look stupid on them.

11) after you finish fnaf plus, do you want to or expect to be in another fanverse “wave”?
not up to me to decide those things. 

wouldn't be opposed to it though.

10) What would you say is your favorite part about working on FNaF+?
getting to "fix", change or do some of the things i've thought FNAF should've be doing for years now is very satisfying.

9) What would you say the is biggest obstacle you have come across while developing FNAF+
animation, i was still fairly new to animation before the start of the project, had to learn a bunch of stuff along the way.

8) Your favorite fnaf plus animatronic?

i still wanna make PHS after Plus is over with yes.

not Scott, not me either.
